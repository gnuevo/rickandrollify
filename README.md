==============

This Firefox extension changes every anchor in a web page so that it redirects to Rick Astley's [famous song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

### So is this remotely useful?
No, it's not.

### If not, what's the purpose of this?
I just wanted to experiment with Firefox extensions and I think this qualifies as a nice hello world.
